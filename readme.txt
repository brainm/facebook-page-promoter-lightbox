== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q. How to obtain my Facebook FanPage ID?:**

A. <a href=\"http://arevico.com/retrieving-the-facebook-fanpage-id/\">*http://arevico.com/retrieving-the-facebook-fanpage-id/*</a> has good instruction on how to get the fanpage id   

**Q. I'm getting error: Could not retrieve id for the specified page. Please verify correct href was passed in.**

A. This plugins only works with facebook Fan pages, make sure to put in the numeric id of your Facebook Fanpage.

**Q. Can i hide it when the user already liked it?:**

A. Currently this is not possible, due the complexity I might implement this in the premium version. However, it is not very likely to be implemented as the user will need to authenticate the app which defeats the whole purpose of a likebox.
